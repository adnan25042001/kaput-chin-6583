## Introduction
Our obejective was to create a pixel-perfect clone of the website - monday.com, which is a digital work management tool that lets users track and coordinate projects.
Our clone consists of 5 pages - Home Page, Product page, Enterprise page, Pricing page and Dashboard page. The website has basic functionalities like - hovering effects,dropdown menu, scroll effect, and shows invalid user input error messages.

## Different Pages
#### Home Page
The Home Page is the first page of the clone, which connects to all other pages. It consists of a fixed navigation bar with a dropdown menu for each of the options. The navigation bar is common for all the pages. The home page has information about the company, its clients, its objectives, and a footer which is common in every page.
